🛍️ PRIMA Girls Shop: Simple Static E-commerce App
This is a modern, simple, and responsive shopping application designed for easy administration and order placement via WhatsApp. It is built entirely using client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and uses a Google Sheet as its product database.

✨ Key Features
Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile viewing.

Spreadsheet as Database: Products are fetched dynamically from a published Google Sheet CSV link, allowing the administrator to update inventory and pricing without touching the code.

WhatsApp Checkout: Users can add items to a cart and click one button to generate a pre-filled order message sent directly to the admin's WhatsApp number.

Direct Chat: A floating WhatsApp button allows customers to start a conversation instantly.
